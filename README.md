# Baseball Hack Day 2016

### **MLB Injury Alert** is designed to send you real time updates of players' injury status. It was built at [Boston Baseball Hack Day 2016](http://www.baseballhackday.com/boston/)

#### [Live demo](http://baseball-hack-day.meteor.com/)

The app isn't polling the SportsRadar API, so it won't send out text messages unless you send the updates yourself by posting data [like this](http://api.sportradar.us/mlb-t5/league/injuries.json?api_key=etdrjj3cz8egbv6fhz69gj5c) to: http://baseball-hack-day.meteor.com/api/injuries
